# CSCI375_QA_System
We will be using Python3 for this project.
## Package Syncing
Create a virtual environment called `venv` and connect to it:
```
$ python3 -m venv venv/
$ source venv/bin/activate
```
You should then see that you are connected to the `venv` vitual environment. You can now install the required packages using `pip`:
```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
You can now run `pip3 freeze` to check that the packages have been installed.
